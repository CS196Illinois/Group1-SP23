I love Taylor Swift!

Notes on Android Studio:
1. Layout - how app should look
- view - rectangular area on the screen, could be buttons or hold text
2. Activity - the code behind the layout
- where you tell the buttons what to do
3. we can drag whatever we want on our layout using the side bar
- for example, we can drag a button from the side bar into our layout page
